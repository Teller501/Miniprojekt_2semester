*Ã˜nskeskyen* was created back in 2015 as a new service to allow users to create digital wish lists.

You can create an infinite number of wish lists with different wishes, and there is even an auto-fill feature if you have the link.

In addition, you can share your wish list with other users, and they can then go in and reserve wishes so that others cannot access the same wishes. This way you avoid getting the same gift from different people.

*Amazon Wishlist* allows users to add items from Amazon.com to their wishlist.

It makes it easy to keep track of items they want to buy or receive as gifts. Users can share their wishlist with friends and family, and can even set up notifications for when prices drop on their wishlist items.

The downside of this is, it's only available with Amazon items, so you can't add anything else.

*Giftster* is another wishlist service that allows users to create wishlists for themselves and their family members. 

Users can add items from any website to their wishlist using a browser extension, and can share their wishlist with family members to make gift giving easier.
